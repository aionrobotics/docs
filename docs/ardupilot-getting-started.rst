.. warning:: *** DANGER!! IMPORTANT!! MUST READ FIRST!! ***

All products go through a thorough quality assurance inspection before shipping. However, during the rigors of shipping, damage, loosening and/or shifting of bolts and other hardware can occur.

To ensure safe functioning of your UGV please complete a pre-operational inspection immediately upon opening the shipping box. If you suspect damage, take pictures of both the damage and shipping box then notify the shipping carrier and Aion Robotics.


.. warning::	When removing the top cover, always use extreme caution and remember to carefully disconnect cabling as required. **Failure to do so will damage components.**


.. warning::	The R1 is equipped with Brushed DC motors, all metal 40:1 gearboxes and bushing style bearings. Each motor is capable of 350 oz-in stall torque and rated at 14 watts. Operation outside of this limit will cause heat buildup, decrease motor life or damage the motors.


.. warning::	Due to the sensitive nature of electronics and robotics platforms in general, the R1 does not come with a warranty. **ALWAYS** use caution!
