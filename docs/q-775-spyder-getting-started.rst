.. warning:: *** DANGER!! IMPORTANT!! MUST READ FIRST!! ***

All Q-775 Spyder aircraft must pass a thorough quality assurance inspection and undergo a test flight before shipment.

During the rigors of shipping, damage, loosening and/or shifting of bolts and other hardware can occur.

To ensure safe functioning of your aircraft please complete a pre-flight inspection immediately upon receipt.

If you suspect damage, take pictures of both the damage and shipping box and immediately notify both the shipping carrier and AION ROBOTICS.

.. warning::	Due to the sensitive nature of electronics and robotics platforms in general, our aircraft do not come with a warranty. **ALWAYS** use caution!
