.. warning:: *** DANGER!! IMPORTANT!! MUST READ FIRST!! ***

All Q-775 Spyder aircraft go through a thorough quality assurance inspection and undergo a test flight before shipping.

However, during the rigors of shipping, damage, loosening and/or shifting of bolts and other hardware can occur.

To ensure safe functioning of your UGV please complete a pre-operational inspection immediately upon receipt of your aircraft. If you suspect damage, take pictures of both the damage and shipping box and immediately notify both the shipping carrier and AION ROBOTICS.


.. warning::	Due to the sensitive nature of electronics and robotics platforms in general, our aircraft do not come with a warranty. **ALWAYS** use caution!
